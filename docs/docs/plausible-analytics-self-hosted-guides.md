[Plausible Analytics Self-Hosted](https://plausible.io/self-hosted-web-analytics) is our free as in beer and free as in speech version of Plausible Analytics. Itâ€™s exactly the same product as our Plausible Analytics Cloud solution, only the self-hosted version you have to install, host and manage yourself. To get started, follow our up-to-date [self-hosting installation instructions](self-hosting.md).
