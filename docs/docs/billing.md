Answers to frequently asked questions about billing, invoicing and payments:

## Is the billing based per account or per website?

The billing is based on the total number of pageviews between all of the sites you have added to your account. You can see this total number of billable pageviews at any time in your account settings.

## How do I get an invoice?

Our payment processor Paddle sends an invoice to you via email automatically upon each payment. You can click on a link within this email to download your invoice.

## Do you support any alternative payment methods?

Credit card and PayPal are the only supported payment methods. We cannot accept payments by wire transfer, invoicing or cryptocurrency unfortunately. All of our payment processing is done by Paddle. We're a small team with limited resources so cannot deal with billing ourselves. 

## How do I change my billing address?

You can change the billing address yourself by opening your invoice and clicking the "Edit business address".

## How do I get a VAT refund?

During the upgrade process, you have the option to add your company address and VAT ID. Our payment processor Paddle handles all the VAT and other sales taxes, so if you're eligible no VAT will be charged on your subscription.

If you haven't added your company details during the subscription process, you can open the invoice that Paddle sent you and click on the "Add address & VAT Number" link to do so.

## What happens if I go over my monthly page views limit?

You will never be charged extra for an occasional traffic spike. We will not stop counting your stats and you will keep having access to your dashboard. There are no surprise fees and your card will never be charged unexpectedly. Suppose new higher traffic levels become your new standard and your page views exceed your subscription plan for two consecutive months. In that case, we kindly ask you to upgrade your subscription plan to accommodate your new traffic levels using our self-serve platform.

## How does the billing work if I upgrade my subscription to a higher tier?

Our payment processor Paddle will calculate a pro-rated amount which reflects the amount you have paid on your previous subscription and the amount of time until that subscription was supposed to expire.
