title: Change your reporting timezone
---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Within the "**General**" section of your website settings you can change the timezone for your reports in the "**Reporting Timezone**" field. This sets the day boundary of your reports regardless of where your traffic is coming from. 

For instance, if you select "**(GMT+01:00) Amsterdam, Berlinâ€¦**" then the beginning and the end of each day of your reporting is calculated based on the time in Amsterdam, even if your visitors come from London or New York. 

The best practice is to set the timezone that reflects the location of your audience or if the audience is very broad and spread across the world to set the timezone of your location.
